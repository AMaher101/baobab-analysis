# baobab-analysis
Investigates potential mechanisms by which a fungal infection has been spreading and infecting baobab trees throughout southwest Madagascar. 

## Context

Baobab trees in southwest Madagascar, natively called “Trees of Life,” have been vital to local communities for centuries, providing food, medicine, shelter, and various other resources. In recent times however, a fungal infection, exhibited as a “marary pattern” on the tree’s bark, has grown rampant across the region, resulting in increased tree mortality. 

## Methodology 

- In the notebook labeled `baobab_questions.ipynb`, correlations between the extent of the exhibited marary pattern and biophysical variables offering insights into its dissemination were analyzed—such as tree height, circumference, surrounding vegetation, extent of bark stripping (indicative of human interaction), soil type, and altitude.
- In the notebook labeled `baobab_plotter.ipynb`, spatial distributions among baobab trees throughout Fokontanies (local villages) and within more compact clusters were examined in addition to an analysis of surrounding ecological communities. 

## Findings

A significant association with soil type was found, revealing baobab trees in purely sand or sandy soil were less likely to display the marary
pattern. These findings suggest that soil composition may play a critical role in the spread of the fungal infection. 

Through identifying environmental factors responsible for exacerbating this disease, this research not only contributes to preserving baobab populations but also highlights the vulnerability of ecosystems to environmental stressors, serving as a microcosm of how localized ecological challenges can reflect broader patterns of disruption driven by climate change.
